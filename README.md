My Education Project Website
Ece's Book World
This is the website I have prepared for my ongoing education. 
It includes HTML, CSS, and JS code. 
You can access the homepage of the website from the index1 page.
 It features a search section where you can perform searches, a navigation bar consisting of 
 Home, Books, About, Contact, and Sign In buttons, a section for viewing individual books,
 and a footer section for accessing other details. 
 Clicking on the books will take you to a page with details about them. 
 The website also includes a star-based rating system for books and a "Read" button to add books you've read to your list.
  Some of the CSS and JS code sources are mentioned in the content's license.
